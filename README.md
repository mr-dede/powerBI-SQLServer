# Course: PorwerBI + SQLServer

I actively participated in the PowerBI + SQL Server course, contributing to the production of various practical projects that enhance the learning experience. This course is a practical and comprehensive journey, starting from scratch and guiding participants in building Dashboards with the Power BI and SQL Server tools.

Throughout the course, I applied my knowledge to the construction of Dashboards using diverse sources such as Excel, CSV, Web, and Databases, providing a holistic understanding of data modeling processes. Additionally, we explored fundamental theoretical aspects, including Data Modeling, Insight, DAX, M, and Database Queries.

A unique feature of the course is the constant updating of projects, keeping them aligned with the constantly evolving demands of the market. Whether you are a beginner or already have some knowledge, the course adapts, escalating the level of complexity as we progress. For those with prior familiarity, the course covers advanced topics such as MAPS, FACT DIMENSION MODELS, M LANGUAGE, and soon, an introduction to Power BI with SQL Server.

The provided support materials, including exercise sources, a digital handbook, backgrounds, and guidance, further enrich the experience. As an active participant, I can attest that the course offers not only practical skills in Power BI and SQL Server but also a solid understanding of the underlying theoretical principles. This learning journey has prepared me to tackle real-world challenges in the field of data analysis and Dashboard construction, providing a practical and valuable educational experience.
